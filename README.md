Monk - Minimum est Maximum.

<h2>What The Hell Is Monk?</h2>

Well, <b>Monk</b> is a very cool project of mine, I guess.<br />
<b>Monk</b>'s idea is to be the "New Wordpress", but for jornalists who LOVE minimal design, minimal mess, etc.
<hr />
<b>Monk</b> is running on PHP, JavaScript & jQuery, CSS3 and obiously HTML5.<br />

<b>Monk</b> designed for the cool, awesome, indie people, who don't care for fancy plugins, big-weight-jQuery-flooded themes, etc. <b>Monk</b> is for the people who loves the small, almost untoched nature of things. 

<b>Monk</b> is for those who doesn't care about widgets, but about Writing, Blogging, etc.
<br /><br />
Monk is for you.

<h2>About the author</h2>
Hello, my name is <b>Ido Daniel</b> (I know, I have a wierd name). I'm a 15 years old student, who lives in Tel Mond, Israel. I began my journey at programming at age 12, and since then I just got better. Nowdays, I dare to say I'm pretty awesome at PHP and HTML5. <br />
I know still have a lot to learn, especially on JavaScript, jQuery and CSS3; but hey, I'm only 15! :D<br />

Maybe I'll just stop talking and let PHP do the work for me:
```php
<?php
function awesomeIt($someGuy) {
$awesomeness = global $monk;
while ($someGuy + $awesomeness > âˆž) {
    $someGuy += $awesomeness;
  }
}

awesomeIt(global $you);

?>
```
